# MilkyWay 3

### MilkyWay 3 is the most advanced tweak for multitasking

**Features**

- Multi-window mode
- Resizing each windows
- Minimising / Maximising windows

... and more!

This tweak adds multi-window capability to iOS, just like a modern desktop OS.

For example, you can play a game and have other apps open at the same time, or even control (tap) other apps at the same time.

### Usage

**The first time you start, you will need access to settings to activate the tweak!**

Windowing your app: In AppSwitcher, long tap on the target app

Close window: Tap the red button

Minimise window: Tap the yellow button

Maximise window: Tap the green button

Move window: Hold and move the top bar

Resize window: hold the grey button on the right end of the top bar to resize (double tap to lock/unlock aspect ratio)

### Support

This tweak works on all versions and devices from iOS 13 to iOS 14.

However, support for iOS13 will only be available until checkra1n is fully compatible with iOS14.

If all iOS14 devices can be jailbroken using checkra1n or any other software, we will no longer support iOS13.

If you encounter any problems with the latest version, please contact us. We will do our best to fix it as soon as possible.

Support is available on Twitter [@soh_satoh](https://twitter.com/soh_satoh) or on [our official Discord account](https://discord.com/invite/Ab2ZF9m).

As for Twitter, we may not receive any notifications, so we will only send out information from us.

If you need help, please contact Discord. (English only)

### Feature Request

### Future Updates

We are going to maintain this package up to the last minor update of iOS 15.

However, in the event of unforeseen problems caused by a major update released by Apple, there may be times when it is slow or impossible to provide updates.

In most cases, the problem is not that big a deal, but we value the user's choice most of all.

We hope you will think twice before buying this package.

### Refund Policy

**Wrong purchase/Change of mind**

Due to the impossibility of us investigating these reasons, we are unable to offer refunds for these reasons.

We recommend that you consider looking at other people's reviews before you buy.

**Bugs**

Refund requests due to bugs will be refunded if we are unable to fix them within one month.

Please report the bug first on Discord or Twitter. Without the help of our users, it may be difficult for us to fix the bug.

If a tweak causes a crash, it is mandatory to submit a crash log for it.

We also reserve the right to refuse a refund in the unlikely event that the bug is specific to your device, caused by another tweak, or caused by software designed to crack it.

Also, due to the way this tweak works, the app may be forced to quit due to lack of memory if a large number of apps are windowed. This is unlikely to happen in general use, but this is a specification.

### Troubleshooting

**Tweak is not working properly**

We have tested this software many times during its development.

However, it is still possible for bugs to occur.

If we receive a bug report similar to the one you are facing, we will address it as soon as possible.

However, if the bug is specific to your device, most likely due to a tweak conflict or network environment, we will not be able to help you.

If this is the case, please use iCleaner or similar to disable all tweaks except MilkyWay3 or change your network environment.

### Notice

We collect the UDID and device model, only for activating tweak.
